# LinearAlgebraCalculators
## Description
This project is just little "calculators" or programs that solve various Linear Algebra problems.

## Purpose
This project is mainly just for me to learn more about Linear Algebra. Being able to take a new idea or concept, deconstruct it, then apply it is a great way to demonstrate learning. I am sure there are other very similar programs that already exist.

## Files included
#### Folder of Matrix file examples
Several file examples
#### matrixType.py
A python program that outputs the type of matrix given.

## Construction
As of now, each program should take a file name input over the command line, then output the solution over the commandline. Each matrix file should have 1 space seperating each element, and a new line for each column.

## Future plans
As of now, I just want several individual "calculator" programs. Each program should have a single purpose.

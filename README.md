# LinearAlgebraCalculators
## Description
This project is just little "calculators" or programs that solve various Linear Algebra problems.

## Purpose
This project is mainly just for me to learn more about Linear Algebra. Being able to take a new idea or concept, deconstruct it, then apply it is a great way to demonstrate learning. I am sure there are other very similar programs that already exist.

## Files included

## Construction
As of now, each program should take an input over the command line, then output the solution over the commandline.

## Future plans
As of now, I just want several individual "calculator" programs. Each program should have a single purpose.
